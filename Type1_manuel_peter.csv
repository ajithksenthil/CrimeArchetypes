Kneiland charge: Peter’s facial scratches were explained by his previous fight, no skin samples were taken from victim’s body. 
Platt charge: said the razor had been in his house long before the time of the break-in 
Martin charge: Tallis knew full descriptions of the rings; Tallis said he read about them in the paper on 17 Sept, when they weren’t officially confirmed to be missing until 21 Sept. 
Watt murders: Watt had no motive to kill his family, but Manuel had even less of a motive to shoot these 3 people 
Houston house breaking: claimed to be watching television at the time and could give detail on the programs he watched. 
Cooke murder: Manuel was at the cinema at the time of the murder; claimed if he killed someone he’d take care to not be seen (an eye witness picked him out) 
Smart murders: the link between him and the murders was “extremely thin”; also not being the “confessing type” it was inexplicable for him to have simply confessed on his own free will",
