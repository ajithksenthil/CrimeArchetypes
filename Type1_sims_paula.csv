06/05/1986,27,"First child, a daughter, Loralei Marie Sims, was born at 6:03 p.m.",
06/17/1986,27,"Loralei was stolen from the family’s home late at night, supposedly by a man dressed in black, who held a gun on Paula, forcing her to lie on the basement floor, while he then took Loralei from the house. Paula ran to her neighbor’s home, the Grays, and told them that Loralei had been taken by someone. Minnie Gray told her husband to call the police. Minnie went back to the Sims’ home after Paula to stay with her until the police arrived on the scene. She let out the family’s dog by accident, and Paula got him back in, stating I can’t lose you too. Minnie remembered Paula telling her that the dog barked at anyone who came near their home, and she asked Paula if the dog had barked, because she did not hear him. Paula said that he didn’t bark, because he must have been in another room in the basement and did not hear the intruder, which Minnie felt was very weird, because the dog barked all the time, and could not see how a man breaking into their home would go unnoticed by this dog.",

kidnapped from her home. The skeletal remains were found 150 feet behind the family’s home in the woods. A raccoon had carried the body down the hill.

06/14/1986,27,"Police later learned after investigating the murder of Loralei, that Paula had taken the baby out to Jack’s Hallmark Card Shop, in Jerseyville, the morning of the 14th, which was the day before father’s day. Paula had lied to the police, stating she had never taken the baby out of the house. This gave the police reason to doubt the Sims’ statements about the case. The Sims was already suspects in the police’s eyes, and this did not help them.",
07/11/1986,27,Detective Gantner told the Post-Dispatch that there was no way to prove that the remains found on June 24th  were the remains of Loralei.

They were told of a new kind of test which was available using genetic factors in the blood. The test was only being performed in two laboratories at this time, one in Phoenix, and the other in Atlanta. They chose Dr. Schanfield at the Allo Type Genetic Testing, Inc. laboratory in Atlanta, to do the testing.",
08/19/1986,27,"Loralei’s remains were delivered to the Allo laboratory, along with blood samples from Paula. Ten days later, the results arrived. Detective Yocom read through three pages of the report before finding the answer on the third page, it was Loralei’s remains. It was 97.2 percent certain. Dr. 
Schanfield had stated that only 95 percent was required to be accepted in court as positive identification of the remains.",
