His teacher gets angry and Jerry becomes embarrassed and leaves the room.",
    "Jerry fails second grade. He is diagnosed with the measles, sore throats, swollen glands and laryngitis during this time. He had to get several operations on his extremities to fight against fungal infections. He also complained of frequent headaches that often left him unable to see clearly. School officials thought that eyeglasses might solve these problems, and also alleviate the problems he was having in school. However, the optometrist did not find a significant need for glasses. A thin prescription was given to Jerry with the thought that they might function similar to a drug placebo. His headaches persisted, and eventually his IQ was tested which came out to be within the normal range.",
    "Jerry\u2019s family moves twice more during this time to Grants Pass, Oregon and then to Wallace Pond, Oregon. At Grants Pass Jerry\u2019s neighbors had several teenage girls and Jerry began to sneak into the house with the girl\u2019s brother and play with girls\u2019 clothes. At this time Jerry\u2019s shoe fetish expands to women\u2019s undergarments. At Wallace Pond Jerry\u2019s father enters back into the agricultural industry.",
    "His brother Larry was now 16 and had a normal fascination with the nude female body. Larry drew several pictures of nude females and kept them hidden in the fear that his disapproving mother would find them and become angry.

    "Jerry begins to go through puberty. His mother again shows her disgust for anything sexual in nature, even forcing Jerry to wash his stained sheets by hand. Jerry begins to have bizarre fantasies. He fantasized that he would capture a girl force her to obey his commands and beg for mercy. His family moves again to Corvallis Oregon where Larry is studying electronics at Oregon State University. Jerry continues his habit of stealing women\u2019s shoes and undergarments, and uses them to enhance the pleasure of masturbation.",
    "Jerry steals the undergarments of an 18-year-old girl. Jerry decides he wants to get a nude photograph of the girl instead of relying on the undergarments for his sexual pleasure. He set up an elaborate plot to get the girl to pose for the nude photo. Jerry asked the girl to come to his house under the guise that he could help her get back her undergarments. When the girl arrived she was accosted by a masked man with a knife that forced her to remove her clothes and took several photos. The man left and the girl got dressed and fled. Before she could get away she ran into Jerry who said he saw the intruder and was locked in the barn. The girl left and informed the police of what had happened.",
    "Jerry lured a 17-year-old girl to his car. Jerry drove her to a deserted farmhouse where he beat her profusely. A couple stopped on the scene of the crime and notified the police. Jerry claimed that he had stopped to help the girl himself and was not the attacker. The couple did not believe Jerry, and eventually the Oregon state police obtained a confession. In Jerry\u2019s house and car they found woman\u2019s undergarments, photos, photo equipment, and Jerry was arrested for assault and battery.",

    "While working at the radio station, Jerry meets his future wife, Darcie Metzler, who was 17 at this time. The two began going out and Darcie\u2019s parents did not approve of this relationship.

At this point police are onto the killer\u2019s pattern and are staking out all areas where young attractive women are present. A female student that claimed to have gone on one of the blind dates gives the police a description of Jerome Brudos.",
    "Jerry attempts to contact the same girl a second time. The girl informed police and Jerry was questioned at the girl\u2019s residence hall. Jerry cooperated and his information came back legitimate so he was not arrested. Subsequently, the police examined Brudos\u2019 record and decided to go to his home for some follow up questions. At the house they saw several suspicious items in the garage and began building a case.",
