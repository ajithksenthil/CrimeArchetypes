# Archetypal Pattern Guide

## Understanding the 4-Animal State Space

The behavioral patterns are categorized into four states based on two dimensions:
- **Self/Other**: Focus of attention
- **Explore/Exploit**: Behavioral mode

| State | Dimensions | Description | Risk Indicator |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Seeking** | Self + Explore | Introspection, fantasy | Building pressure |
| **Directing** | Other + Exploit | Control, violence | Active danger |
| **Conferring** | Other + Explore | Observation, stalking | Target selection |
| **Revising** | Self + Exploit | Rituals, habits | Predictable MO |

## Archetypal Roles

### SOURCES

**Members**: 3

**Summary**: SOURCES archetype: Directing dominant (68.0%), dominated by control/exploitation behaviors, active surveillance/observation periods

**State Distribution**:
- Seeking: 9.7%
- Directing: 68.0%
- Conferring: 15.8%
- Revising: 6.5%

**Key Patterns**:
- Trajectory: Consistent Directing pattern throughout
- Escalation: Strong escalation pattern - Directing behavior increases significantly over time
- Risk Profile: Active harm, peak danger phase

**Common Sequences**:
- Directing → Directing (3x) - Sustained predatory activity
- Directing → Seeking (2x) - Post-offense introspection/guilt
- Revising → Directing (2x) - Ritual triggering offense

### SINKS

**Members**: 3

**Summary**: SINKS archetype: Directing dominant (68.0%), dominated by control/exploitation behaviors

**State Distribution**:
- Seeking: 15.7%
- Directing: 68.0%
- Conferring: 11.3%
- Revising: 5.0%

**Key Patterns**:
- Trajectory: Trajectory shifts from Seeking to Directing
- Escalation: Strong escalation pattern - Directing behavior increases significantly over time
- Risk Profile: Active harm, peak danger phase

**Common Sequences**:
- Directing → Directing (3x) - Sustained predatory activity
- Directing → Conferring (3x) - Returning to surveillance after action
- Seeking → Directing (2x) - Fantasy-to-action escalation

---

### HUBS

**Members**: 4

**Summary**: HUBS archetype: Directing dominant (52.1%), dominated by control/exploitation behaviors, significant introspective phases, active surveillance/observation periods, ritualistic/compulsive elements

**State Distribution**:
- Seeking: 21.6%
- Directing: 52.1%
- Conferring: 15.7%
- Revising: 10.6%

**Key Patterns**:
- Trajectory: Consistent Directing pattern throughout
- Escalation: Strong escalation pattern - Directing behavior increases significantly over time
- Risk Profile: Active harm, peak danger phase

**Common Sequences**:
- Directing → Directing (4x) - Sustained predatory activity
- Directing → Seeking (4x) - Post-offense introspection/guilt
- Seeking → Directing (4x) - Fantasy-to-action escalation

---

### GENERAL

**Members**: 16

**Summary**: GENERAL archetype: Directing dominant (74.1%), dominated by control/exploitation behaviors

**State Distribution**:
- Seeking: 10.5%
- Directing: 74.1%
- Conferring: 9.8%
- Revising: 5.6%

**Key Patterns**:
- Trajectory: Consistent Directing pattern throughout
- Escalation: Strong escalation pattern - Directing behavior increases significantly over time
- Risk Profile: Active harm, peak danger phase

**Common Sequences**:
- Directing → Directing (16x) - Sustained predatory activity
- Seeking → Directing (12x) - Fantasy-to-action escalation
- Conferring → Directing (11x) - Observation leading to action

## Tracking These Patterns

To use this framework for analysis:

1. **Classify events** using the 4-Animal State Space
2. **Compute behavioral signature** (state distribution, transitions)
3. **Identify role** (Source, Sink, Hub) based on influence patterns
4. **Track escalation** by comparing early vs late phase distributions
5. **Monitor key transitions** especially Seeking→Directing (fantasy-to-action)

## Warning Signs

High-risk transitions to monitor:
- **Seeking → Directing**: Fantasy escalating to action
- **Conferring → Directing**: Observation phase ending, action beginning
- **Persistent Directing**: Sustained predatory activity
- **Increasing Directing over time**: Clear escalation pattern
