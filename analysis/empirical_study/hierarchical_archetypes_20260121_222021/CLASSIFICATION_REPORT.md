# Hierarchical Archetype Classification Report

## Overview

This report presents the results of the two-level hierarchical archetype classification system.

### Classification Approach

**Level 1 (Data-Driven):** Primary types determined by hierarchical clustering
- Validated by silhouette score analysis (k=2 optimal)
- COMPLEX vs FOCUSED distinction emerges naturally from data

**Level 2 (Theory-Driven):** Subtypes based on 4-Animal framework
- Refinements within each primary type
- Criteria based on state distributions, transitions, and escalation patterns

## Results Summary


### COMPLEX (3 individuals, 12%)

*Multi-modal behavioral pattern with unpredictable state transitions*

**Risk Level:** UNPREDICTABLE - Difficult to anticipate; utilizes multiple behavioral modes

| Subtype | Count | Members |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Chameleon | 2 | Armstrong, Baumeister |
| Multi-Modal | 1 | Bathory |

### FOCUSED (23 individuals, 88%)

*Directing-dominant pattern with clear escalation trajectory*

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Predictable escalation pattern; sustained exploitation behavior

| Subtype | Count | Members |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Strong Escalator | 8 | Alcala., Archer-Gilligan, Barfield, Berdella, Bianchi, ... (+3 more) |
| Stalker-Striker | 8 | Anderson, Beets, Bernardo, Bittaker, Black, ... (+3 more) |
| Pure Predator | 4 | Blank, Bonin, Buono, Cleaned |
| Fantasy-Actor | 3 | Allanson, Browne, Brudos |

## Methodology

### Level 1: Primary Type Classification

Primary types are determined using Ward's hierarchical clustering on a 9-dimensional feature space:
- State distribution (4 features): % in each of the 4 Animal states
- State persistence (4 features): Self-loop probability for each state
- Escalation (1 feature): Change in Directing % from early to late phases

The optimal number of clusters (k=2) was determined by silhouette analysis.

### Level 2: Subtype Classification

Within each primary type, individuals are classified into subtypes based on:

**COMPLEX Subtypes:**
- **Chameleon**: ≥3 active states, <60% in any single state
- **Multi-Modal**: 2+ active states, default for COMPLEX without Chameleon criteria

**FOCUSED Subtypes:**
- **Pure Predator**: ≥75% Directing, high persistence
- **Strong Escalator**: Escalation score ≥0.35
- **Stalker-Striker**: Has Conferring→Directing transitions
- **Fantasy-Actor**: Has Seeking→Directing but NOT Conferring→Directing
- **Standard**: Meets FOCUSED criteria without distinctive subtype features
