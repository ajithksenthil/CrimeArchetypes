*N/A means that this data was not found.  Our group did an extensive search through books, online publications, LexisNexis, newspapers, Ancestory.com, and received help from the Reference Desk in the Library. This is all the information we could gather on Virginia McGinnis.  She is nota very well-known serial killer; however, her story is interesting nonetheless. We wish we could find more on her, but the information out there is limited.  The book “Death Benefit” was more of a narrative of the lawyer who got involved in Deanna Wild’s death and uncovered the truth about her murder. The other victims’ information was much harder to find and background information on McGinnis as well.",
