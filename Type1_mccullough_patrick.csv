milligrams of Mellaril three times a day.  He was entered into an eight-week summer school program at Rosewood when his behavior improved and during many parts of the class he would sit by himself with a book he could not yet read.

Before he left he was fitted with a hearing aid that Patrick would often tend to “lose.”  Later tests showed that he really had no use for the hearing aid because his hearing was too impaired. Patrick was now enrolled in Oakland School where an oral-only method was still used and he was forbidden to use sign language. Patrick would also be sent away by his parents when “speaking adults” would come over to the house, leaving Patrick to feel dumb and embarrassed.  The school noticed pains in Patrick’s head and stomach that lasted about a half hour, after which he became sleepy.  These symptoms pointed to possible epilepsy. Clinicians, however, diagnosed that Patrick had no definite evidence of neurological impairment and was placed on Ritalin.","Patrick’s behavior improved and he was now able to be discharged from Rosewoods.

1974,14,Patrick was now enrolled in the Maryland School for the Deaf (MSD),
,,,
,,"in Frederick, Maryland. This seemed to be promising for Patrick unlike the other facilities because MSD was one of the best programs for deaf children. Because of Patrick’s lack of education from not having the proper techniques, he was behind academically and placed in classes with younger students.  This was noticeable for Patrick as well as other students, making Patrick feel dumb.  To overcome his setback, he would use his sense of charm as well as his strength to win over 
teachers, or scare other children into not messing with him. 
Patrick would also use his strength in athletics at MSD, playing 
football, wrestling, and even running track. This gave Patrick 
something to be proud of.  He didn’t seem to have many friends, if any at all, due to his violent behavior. Other children would describe him as “insane” and “a bomb”.  Patrick had many fights while at MSD with students, both male and female, as well as faculty and coaches.  They noticed that Patrick seemed to be almost blacked out when during his fights, afterwards feeling extremely sorry and having little or no memory of the attack.  They thought he might have a type of seizure disorder that caused this.",
1975,15,"Patrick was seen at the Frederick County Health Department Seizure Clinic where he was placed on the medication Mellaril which would hopefully stop the seizures and help control Patrick’s outbreaks. As his violence continued, he was prescribed a greater amount of medication. With his violent acts continuing, MSD decided Patrick was a liability to students and staff. They would not let him attend school again until he could get his anger under proper control. 
The University of Maryland Hospital’s Neurological Unit tested Patrick and revealed no neurological symptoms.  He was then transferred to its Psychological Institute for inpatient treatment. 
While at the Psychological Institute he met a non-deaf girl who he took an interest in. He became somewhat obsessive, attempting to sneak out of the hospital to visit her.  She realized how violent he became and never spoke or saw Patrick again. This is the first we see of Patrick’s obsessive and violent relationships. 
Not long after, Patrick was discharged from the hospital and was able to go back to MSD where he showed improved behavior.",
05/26/1975,15,"The good behavior was short lived when Patrick was not in school. Over the summer he got into an altercation with his mother about his motorcycle. He destroyed the dining room and chased his mother with the leg of the table he had destroyed. Patrick calmed down for a little while when a deaf neighbor interceded, speaking to him in sign language. This lasted long enough for the police to arrive and arrest Patrick.  At this point Patrick’s mother believes that he is tearing the family apart and again asks the courts to declare him a ward of the state. He was then taken to Crownsville Hospital Center, a hospital focusing on the mentally ill. 
At Crownsville he expressed suicidal behavior such as cutting his",

1976,16,"Patrick was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder.  They believed that this is common in patients with brain trauma, something Patrick could have received due to the complications of Rh factor at birth.",
1977,17,"Brent Toleman, a mental-health professional, goes to the Department of Social Services so that Patrick could live with him as a foster son. He believed he could give Patrick the dedication it would take to turn his life around. He found that by having Patrick focus on working on and driving a motorcycle, something Patrick had always been 
interested in, that it calmed him and made him more controllable.  This also gave Patrick a sense of freedom he had not had before. 
Brent enrolled Patrick at Model Secondary School for the Deaf (MSSD). This did not last long considering he was having behavioral problems again, and was also dismissed from MSSD. 
Later that year, Brent attempted to reconnect Patrick with his family. 
Patrick was upset that they did not buy him any presents and upon returning to Brent’s house, he got in a fight with Brent.  This resulted in Social Services taking Patrick out of Brent’s custody and he was returned to Crownsville. He was assigned to the hospital’s maximum security section, a unit for the criminally insane.",

Brent, who was still part of Patrick’s life, urged local hospitals to work with Patrick, all of which denied. Brent then allowed Patrick to move in with him to avoid homelessness and got Patrick a job at a 
construction company. Instead of paying the rent he owed Brent, Patrick went and bought a horse. 
Patrick had many romantic relationships with hearing women.  He attracted hearing women because they would take pity on Patrick and would want to help him.  In every relationship, Patrick would get possessive and would want to spend every waking moment with his interest at the time.  When they would start to realize the intensity of the situation they were in, they would start to back off, sending Patrick into fits of rage. On one occasion Patrick had beat his girlfriend’s dog to death because she wanted to spend some time apart.
