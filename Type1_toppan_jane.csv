,,"In order to overcome this abuse, Jane developed a vivacious personality and denied her Irish heritage by making derogatory Anti-Irish and Anti-Catholic statements in the Protestant circles in which she moved.  While some of her schoolmates liked her a great deal, others despised her as an outrageous liar: she spun tails of her heritage and would often pin her troublesome deeds on other children.  Due to her unhappiness with her situation and the unlikelihood that she would never marry, Jane grew unattractively plump.",

1887,30-31,"It is speculated that Jane killed more than a dozen of patients while working at Cambridge.  One patient, Mrs. Amelia Phinney, lived to later tell the tale of Jane’s maliciousness.  After surgery, Jane administered some bitter tasting medicine to Amelia to help with her pain.  As she was slipping into unconsciousness, she realized that Jane had gotten into bed with her and began kissing her all over her face.  Luckily for Mrs. Phinney, Jane was startled by someone and hastily left the room.

Over 7 days, under the noses of everyone (even a Dr. who had been successful in catching another woman serial killer who used arsenic), Jane poisoned her victim slowly.  She played with Mattie, bringing her in and out of lucidity, only to immediately plunge her deep into a coma.",

In this document, Jane admitted that she wanted the panel of psychiatrists to find her insane.  Upon convincing them of this lie, she felt very smug in knowing that she had outsmarted a panel of “experts.”  Jane described the exquisite pleasure it gave her to kill her patients, and she marveled at the lack of feeling and remorse she felt for doing these horrible things.  In an attempt to show that she was not without feeling, Jane claimed that the jilt she received from the lover in her youth seemed to be the root of all of her problems.  Jane explained, “If I had been a married woman, I probably would not have killed all of those people.  I would have had my husband, my children and my home to take up my mind.”",
